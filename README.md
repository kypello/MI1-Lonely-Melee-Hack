This is a mod/hack of The Secret of Monkey Island that I made

Instructions:

1 - You must first have a copy of the CD version of Secret of Monkey Island, at your own discretion

2 - Use a rom patching tool (such as https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/) and use it to patch the MONKEY1.000 file with the MONKEY1_000.ips patch

3 - Do the same with MONKEY1.001 and MONKEY1_001.ips

4 - Put the patched files in the original game folder, and make sure they are named MONKEY1.000 and MONKEY1.001 as they were before

5 - Add the game folder to ScummVM and it should work hopefully
